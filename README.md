## <sub><img width="28" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ideditor/temaki@master/icons/temaki.svg"/> </sub> Temaki

An icon expansion pack for [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki)

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ideditor/temaki@master/dist/temaki-view.svg)](https://ideditor.github.io/temaki/docs)

See https://ideditor.github.io/temaki/docs for details about each icon.


### What is it?

The [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki) icon pack is pretty great!  I use it in the [iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) and [name-suggestion-index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index) projects, but sometimes:

* I need an icon that's out of scope for Maki
* I don't want to wait for an icon to be added to Maki
* I'm ok with not having 11px versions

So in these situations, I'll just draw something "good enough" and put it here.  (Many of these icons also originally came from the [scottdejonge/map-icons repo](https://github.com/ideditor/temaki/issues/2).)

The Temaki icons are a little bigger and messier than the Maki ones, but just as delicious. :yum:


### Design guidelines

I try to mostly follow the excellent [Maki design guidelines](https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/guidelines/) but these icons are only available in 15px versions.


### Contributing

Icon requests are very welcome!  This project is only for icons that aren't already in [Maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki).
